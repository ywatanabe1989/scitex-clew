"""Lifecycle hook observers (SOC R6).

scitex-clew is the observer; it owns the hooks that other packages fire
into so the umbrella package never has to wire them:

* **io hooks** (``on_io_save`` / ``on_io_load``) — self-registered with
  scitex-io; exception-safe (they MUST NOT raise).
* **session hooks** (``on_session_start`` / ``on_session_close``) — invoked
  by ``@scitex.session`` to open/finalize a tracked run; see
  :mod:`scitex_clew._observers._session`.

    and clew SUBSCRIBES — scitex-session never imports clew, so the seam is
    acyclic. Guarded so an OLD scitex-session without the registry API is a
    silent no-op (same contract as the fallback-import path on the session
    side). Never raises.

    scitex-session fires hooks POSITIONALLY — ``start(session_id, script_path,

    :func:`~scitex_clew.on_session_start` positional order is
    ``(session_id, script_path, parent_session, verbose, metadata)``. So we
    register keyword-mapping ADAPTERS (not the raw callables); a positional
    ``metadata`` never lands in ``parent_session``, and the public hooks stay
    unchanged.
