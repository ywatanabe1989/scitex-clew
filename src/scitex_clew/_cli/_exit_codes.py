"""Nuanced, fail-loud exit codes for ``clew verify`` (claim-set mode).

Motivation
----------
Clew's value is making fabricated-then-claimed-success catchable. A
solver agent can register Clew claims that point at a hand-written
``results.json`` and then print ``DONE`` — but those claims are
``status="registered"`` with ``verified_at=NULL`` and no ``@stx.session``
computation behind the source. Recording that (lack of) provenance is
not enough on its own; ``clew verify`` must *fail loud* with a distinct,
machine-actionable exit code per outcome so a harness can gate ``DONE``
on it.

The contract
------------
A solver MUST run ``clew verify [--strict]`` before signalling ``DONE``.
``DONE`` is legitimate **only** on exit ``0`` (:data:`OK`). Any nonzero
exit means the agent must emit an honest abstention (``null`` + reason)
per the scitexification honest-grounding rule rather than claim success.

Codes
-----
The codes are spread out (10+) so they never collide with click's usage
error (exit ``2``) or a generic Python traceback (exit ``1``). They are a
stable, documented contract — downstream harnesses branch on the integer.

============  =====  ====================================================
Constant      Code   Meaning
============  =====  ====================================================
OK            0      Every registered claim is source-verified (its value
                     hashes to a recorded source). In ``--strict`` mode,
                     every source additionally has upstream
                     ``@stx.session`` lineage (chain verified).
NO_CLAIMS     20     No claims registered at all. There is nothing to
                     stand behind a ``DONE`` — treat as a hard failure for
                     a task that was supposed to produce verifiable claims.
UNVERIFIED    10     Claims exist but at least one is registered-but-
                     unverified: ``verified_at`` is NULL / no source is
                     linked / it never went through a verification pass.
                     THIS IS THE FABRICATION CASE (hand-coded metrics with
                     no computation behind them).
HASH_MISMATCH 12     At least one claim's source file changed after the
                     claim was registered (stored hash != current hash).
                     The artifact was edited / regenerated out of band.
SOURCE_MISSING 11    At least one claim's source file is gone (deleted or
                     never written).
NO_LINEAGE    13     ``--strict`` only: a claim's source hashes fine but
                     has NO upstream computation lineage — it is a
                     hand-written leaf (e.g. a hand-edited ``results.json``)
                     with no ``@stx.session`` / processing chain. Source
                     integrity is intact but provenance is absent.
CITATION_STUB 14     At least one ``\\cite{}`` key resolves to a scholar
                     STUB (note="Auto-generated stub" / journal="Pending
                     scitex-scholar metadata lookup" / no DOI) — a
                     hallucinated / placeholder reference. THE FLAGSHIP
                     "一発アウト" catch (per-key status ``stub``).
CITATION_UNRESOLVED 15  At least one cited key has no confirmed real
                     source yet — registered but scholar has not resolved
                     it to a DOI-bearing source (per-key status
                     ``unverified``).
CITATION_UNLINKED 16  At least one ``\\cite{}`` key present in the
                     manuscript has no clew citation node at all — never
                     registered by scholar and nothing to judge it against
                     (per-key status ``unknown``).
============  =====  ====================================================

When more than one failure class is present across the claim set, the
single returned code is the highest-severity one per :data:`SEVERITY`
(see :func:`worst_code`). Severity is ordered by "what the agent must fix
first": tampering / missing artifacts (hard integrity failures) outrank
the never-computed fabrication case, which outranks missing lineage,
which outranks the empty set.
